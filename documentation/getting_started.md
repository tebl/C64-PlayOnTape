# Getting started
Remember waiting around for what sometimes would feel like forever, just to get your favourite game loaded from your trusty datasette? Well, now you can now attempt to return to a slightly less irritating version of those good old days - loading games'll take just as long as they did back then, just without the need to fiddle with the azimuth setting. Based on the rather excellent [tapuino](https://github.com/sweetlilmre/tapuino) project, there's even an accompanying [blog](http://sweetlilmre.blogspot.com/search/label/Tapuino) that included instructions on how to build one all by yourself.

A device such as the *tapuino* is in most ways, just the same as your trusty old Commodore Datasette (C2N), with one very notable difference - you'll be loading data from an SD-card instead of attempting to use your musty old tapes. From the viewpoint of your Commodore 64 it'll look just the same as the datasette, it's communicating over the same connector and the data will be barrelling down the cable at exactly the same rate (meaning that it'll take just as long to load as well). 

**NB!** These days it has become more and more common to have custom Commodore 64 kernals installed on your system, some of these dropped the tape-support in order to fit their own routines without requiring a larger of ROM chip. The moral of the story is that if something refuses to work, try it with the original ROM-chip in place.

# 1> Loading a game
There isn't really all that much that needs saying when it comes to loading games from tape, but what you'd need to do is enable *SHIFT LOCK*, push *RUN STOP* and then disable *SHIFT LOCK* again. At this point you would pick up your C64 PlayOnTape, browse to a TAP-file of your choice and then select it to start streaming the data to your computer. Check facebook, when the tape has finished loading you'll be able to play your game. That's all, folks!
