# C64 PlayOnTape
Remember waiting forever for your favourite game to load from tape? Well, now you can return to less stressful days and relive the soothing experience of loading C64 games from tape! Based on the excellent [tapuino](https://github.com/sweetlilmre/tapuino) project, there's an even an accompanying [blog](http://sweetlilmre.blogspot.com/search/label/Tapuino) with instructions for building one all by yourself.

Personally I haven't had much success building prototypes on breadboards and veroboard, I highly suspect this is due to my tendency for only buying the cheapest stuff around, so I went straight from his blog to a set of PCB designs instead. Given that I'm the kind of person that enjoy building things once, but have problems finding the motivation for building more than the first one that passes my quality-annoyance control I'm sharing it. So if you want it, it's available to build.
